### Biographical Note

Elmer G. Bracher (RC 1918) was born in 1894 in Rahway, New Jersey, to parents George S. Bracher (1839-1902) and Evelina Johnson (1853-1923). He was the youngest of six children. As a local of Rahway, Bracher and Silvers knew each others' families well. Elmer goes by the nickname "Pi-an" or "Pian" in these letters, the origin of which remains mysterious (to us, at least). Elsewhere, classmates refer to him as "Toady" Bracher.

Bracher's desire to communicate fairly bursts from the page. It's clear that the College, his fellow football teammates (Bracher was a star halfback despite his small stature), and the Delta Phis (his and Silvers's fraternity) constitute his chosen family. He is conspicuously silent about his biological family, despite the fact that Silvers would have known them from town, and Bracher shipped out of Hoboken with his older brother Robert. Bracher's other major topics---who is getting married or engaged, and being at the rear versus the front of the war effort---reveal a preoccupation with contemporaneous attitudes towards masculinity. One senses that the war to him is a giant impediment to maturity. Not only did it cut short his athletic career, but being stationed at a base hospital in Savenay, France, hundreds of miles from the Front, meant that he couldn't as easily demonstrate  soldierly notions of nobility or strength. Nor could he become engaged. He is clearly stung by the news of Mildred Terrill's engagement. Terrill, who Bracher calls "the Voice" (a singer?), was Earl Reed Silvers's sister-in-law, and apparently Rahway's own Helen of Troy. Bracher is not the only one to write of her; in a more humorous vein, Ainsworth claims to be "sore as hell at being thrown over" for Lyle B. Reeb (RC 1919).

Bracher's letters show a certain remove, or even tone-deafness, on the subject of illness and death. He refers to "nut patients" and a "nut hospital" (Base Hospital No. 214, also at Savenay) when speaking of the war's shell shock victims. Of Morris B. Jackson (RC 1919) dying of the flu, he says "[i]t certainly was too bad." And of Chapin Barr (RC 1918) and Rudolph Elmer's (RC 1917) deaths, he merely states that it was news to him that they "kick[ed] in." Bracher himself would die four years after demobilization. He crashed his Stutz touring car into a stationary truck in the early hours of Sunday morning, September 30, 1923, after watching the Rutgers-Penn Military College football game the prior evening. He is thought to have died at the scene.

We have finally arrived in France. The voyage over was calm and uneventful until the last day out, which was Monday. Then we had just sighted land when we heard six short blasts from the whistle. That meant a sub attack. It was a quarter to nine, and the next hour was the most exciting I have ever had. We were on the (censored) which was the largest and most important in the fleet, and they all tried to get her. There was quite a gang of subs, for it was officially reported that we sank five. Believe me, it certainly was great to hear the guns going off and to see the shells hit the water. We didn't see any of the submarines, but we were able to see the white water where the periscopes were. I also saw the wake of a torpedo which passed about fifty yards from our stern.

We lay in the harbor for two days, and on Wednesday started out with full equipment for (censored) where we now are. We left at half—past nine and arrived at half past three. We had five stops and were walking the rest of the time. The distance was eighteen miles, and I never walked so far in all my life. There was quite a bunch that had to fall out. We are situated about four hundred miles from the front, and I think that it will be permanent.

It will probably take me quite a time to compose this letter, with you being a critic and it having to pass the censor. So you know it's pretty hard to write without putting something in that shouldn't be in, so make some allowances. How are you and Eda and everyone else? Are you still running the college? What's <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Ainsworth, William Penn Esterbrook (Pete) | Born: 1893. Died: 1968.

I'm working on the night shift and have spent about twelve francs in the last week. four of that going for laundry and two for some towels. My gosh! if that had been all the money I spent a week while at college, I'd have been a rich man. We work in twelve hour shifts and one certainly is glad when the twelve hours are up. I go on at six P.M. and am off at six A.M. We eat breakfast at seven and then generally sleep from eight until four. Who did you think is in town?

Only had one rough night and that wasn't enough to make one seasick. Believe me, I certainly was glad that I wasn't seasick. I'm stationed in a new addition to the hospital and there are no electric lights in it. Have to see by candlelight, that accounts for my spilling some on this paper. It certainly is a mighty fine night here tonight. There's a most wonderful moon out and it almost makes one wish he were home again. Well, Pro, don't forget to write as often as you can and if you publish any books, send me one. Give my best regards to Eda and everyone else. Hoping I'll see you soon.

One of the fellows had a list of the Fort Meyer appointments and I saw that practically all the fellows from college received their commissions. I sure do hope that the football teams turns out to be a good. I certainly am going to miss playing this year. Send me accounts of the games anyway, will you, Sil for that will help a little.

 Received your letter of Sept. 8 yesterday and it sure was fine to hear from you. We hadn't received any mail since Sept. 11 until yesterday when a big batch came in for us.

I sure hope it is a boy so we'll have another Delt in the Silvers family. Say Pro, tell the "Voice" to write more often. I've only heard from her once since I've been here. Also tell her not to forget to send me an announcement. All the fellows wanted to be remembered to you. They are all well and making out very nicely. Work seems to agree with us all. I can hardly imagine that college has opened and that I would be able to go back. It certainly could be great if all the old gang could get together again. When we  all get back we'll have to have a grand old reunion. That's fine news about Pete. Tell him to let me know his address. Dud surely did a mighty fine thing.

<p class="left">Dear Sil,</p>

Congratulations! I'm mighty glad that the baby is a future Delt, I sure do hope that Eda is up and well. By the time you get this I guess the baby will be almost two months old. The length of time reminds me that I must apologize for not writing sooner. I sure am sorry but, to tell the truth I have neglected my correspondence entirely for the last three weeks or a month and haven't written a single letter. I have reformed however and I am working hard now to get caught up with it. You say you wanted the names of all the men to send them the weekly letter. All the men in our unit seem to be getting them so I won't bother to give you their names. You might send one to Lunker Janeway and to Johnny Morrison *tho* [sic].

It must have been great to watch them play and practice and I sure do wish that I could have seen them. I hope I have better luck next year, [though], of course there's no telling. How is the House getting along. I suppose it has the same old trouble collecting dues and paying bills. How is Duke making as head? I understand that after the fellows had obtained four men that they stopped rushing and let the Chi Phis get some good men that we should have had. I guess it's the same ol story of self—satisfaction isn't it. The chapter sure will die of <i>dry rot [?]</i> if someone doesn't put some pep unto it. Why don't you try and stir them up? Say, Pro, what is the matter with "the Voice" has she become engaged and not allowed to  write or did she cut her hand off. I have written four or five letters to her and only received one from her. That one was received shortly after I landed. I'm going to write one more and then give it up as a hopeless job. This great living on twenty eight dollars a month Sil.

Received your letter the other day and I sure was glad to hear from you. I certainly had looked for it for a long time but, I suppose you are pretty busy and don't have much time to write. I have been receiving the letters from college but, they aren't near as good as personal ones. Received #10 yesterday and saw the notice about the ring.

I sent her one of those rings, too. Don't know what she thought or rather it started a scrap or not. Gee, it must be hell to be in love. I sure would like to see the Voice to see how she acts.

<p class="left">Dear Sil:</p>

Do you know I haven't heard from you in a deuce of a while? I thought I would drop you a line to see if you would answer it to let me know whether you're still alive or not. I've been receiving the College letters regularly as have all of the other fellows here. They are mighty good to read, but, I'd much rather hear from you personally. I certainly have heard some surprising news lately. Shrimp White's and <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Browning, Oren Fogle | Born: 1893. Died: 1963.
Corporal, Infantry.">*Bone's* [sic] Browning</button>'s engagements and the <i>Louse's [?]</i> marriage,  they certainly are things I never did expect to hear at least not for some time to come. How are Eda and the baby? I sure hope they are well and that you have nothing to worry about. I've been put on a new job lately. Have charge of a new kitchen <sup>& mess hall</sup> which we have just started. It isn't finished yet but, when it is it's going to be the best in the hospital. I have to order the stores and draw them, make out the menu and see that the work around the kitchen and hall is done right. With the exception of one cook all the work is done by convalescent patients, and I generally  have quite a job to find them and to do the work. Have three good men who are detailed permanently and that helps a lot. The worst part of it is that you generally get some good men broken in and then they are sent back to duty again. — Have to start all over again then. We still lead the staid respectable life as of yore. Go to bed at a quarter to ten or before and go to <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="a signal used to awaken personnel in the armed forces, typically sounded on the bugle or drums. | From: reveille, n."> <a href="https://www-oed-com.proxy.libraries.rutgers.edu/view/Entry/164685?redirectedFrom=reveille#eid">reveille</a> </button> at six in the morning. "Oh it's nice to get up in the morning," Sil "but its nicer to stay in bed." I sure do hate to get up in the morning. Joe has been pretty sick lately so today he went off on a seven day forlough for a rest. I guess he'll be all right when he comes back at least I hope so for he has had quite a time of it. Well Sil, if you should think to write, I'd be mighty glad to hear from you.

<p class="left">Dear Sil;</p>

Received your letter yesterday and it surely was as unexpected as it was welcome. I had inde<del>d</del>e thought you had forgotten all about me, and had given up all hope of hearing from you. I have been receiving the college letter right along and of course receive all the college news thru it, but, it isn't near as good as hearing from you directly. Things are going along here about the same as usual. Of course the hospital is growing larger and expanding all the while. Instead of one hospital now it has become  a hospital center. <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Base Hospital No. 8 was the one of the largest American military—operated hospitals in France. It handled both medical and surgical patients until August 1918.

I believe that each unit is to have twenty five hundred beds and the center as a whole is planned for thirty or fourty thousand. (I don't know whether that will be passed by the censor or not). At present I am at a new Convalescent Camp which has started up about two miles from [Base Hospital 8] For the moment we only have three hundred beds, but, it is planned for five thousand. I have charge of the <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Quartermasters are in charge of providing food services and supplies, such as ammunition and clothing, to troops. | From: U.S. Army: Quartermaster

Am practically my own boss and take my orders from the [Commanding Officer] of the camp. He is a first Lieutenant in the Med. Corps and surely is a fine fellow. One doesn't mind working for such a man as he is and it is more of a pleasure than work. At present we are living in tents and the storeroom is a room in an old French house which is on the grounds of the Camp. There is an open fireplace in the room and it surely makes it mighty cosy and comfortable in the evening when we have a fire agoing. The evenings  are generally pretty cool now so I usually camp by the fire and read or write or work as the spirit moves me. Sil, I don't believe you will receive many letters from the fellows in this unit, for there really isn't a thing of interest to write about. It seems to us all that we should be up at the front doing something worth while, instead of being stuck away back here. We're just plain out of luck as it is. I'm enclosing a little poem which is mighty applicable to the whole bunch here. With the changing of a few words it would fit us to a T.  I might be able to give you a bit of news about some of the fellows so I'll try. <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Broome, Frank Haviland | Born: 1895.

I wish you would convey to them both my heartiest congratulations and well wishes, Sil. I sure wish them the best luck in the world and privately I think that they will need it. You surely have quite a kid, there in Mike. I'm mighty glad that you sent that picture of him. I only wish that I could see him in action. Start early Sil and train him in the  right way. When he grows up and wants to play football I imagine you will hear an awful yowl from Eda. Gosh, I was kicking a football around tonight for the first time in many moons and it surely did feel good to have the old pigskin in my hands again. Just at present it looks pretty black for my ever playing again. You surely are out of luck with [your] car, aren't you? How do you blame it on smoking? I think that I agree with you about rather smoking than hear people talk. I sure hope the deafness passes away  altogether. I think I have just about written myself out Sil, so it is about time to knock off. I had a <i>hunch [?]</i> that I would be able to write quite a lot of bull when I started so that is the reason why I used a pencil. I never would have finished it with a pen. I tell you this is just about the longest letter that I have written since I have been over here. Give my best to Eda and Mike and all the rest and for Pete's sake live up to what you said you were going to do in regards to writing. But, never expect such a long letter in answer again. Be good.

<p class="left">Dear Sil:</p>

Just received your letter dated Aug 28. tonight and it certainly was very welcome. You know I answered your last letter with pencil and that sort of started me in to write altogether that way. Have written several others, and I find that it is so much easier that I think that I shall continue it. My Lord is everybody getting married now adays. The old world certainly will seem strange with everybody married and grown up. You know, Sil, I don't think that I have changed a bit since I left. Haven't any more sense than I did have  and I guess I am as much of a kid as I ever was. My Lord I'm twenty five now, and I sure never am able to realize it. Such is life, without a wife.

Have a care as to how you address me next time. I might become sore and report you for familiarity, mais je n'ai sais pas. But, joking aside, Sil, I meant to answer your letter before this but, haven't had the time or the <i>[?]</i>. Been busy as the deuce lately. Just received about six hundred additional patients and have had to do some tall hustling to get [accommodations] for them. To make matters worse it has been raining for about the last two weeks and the roads are something awful around the camp. Generally get stuck two or three times a day and either  have to get another truck to pull mine out or else dig it out. Was mighty lucky today, only was stuck once. [They're] building a good rock road now and when that is finished it sure will help a lot.

Next time you write to Shrimp White tell him that he owes me a letter. The poor boob wrote to me once  and I answered him, but haven't heard a pup out of him since. Bawl him out for me. That is fine news about Pete. He always will make good at anything he tries. Had a letter from Bruce <i>MacWhig [?]</i> the other day.

Also heard from Van Ludlow today. He is still in Paris but, says it is becoming rather  tiresome. He is pulling strings for a commission or at least to get to a training school. Says it looks pretty prosperous for him. The old college must be quite changed nowadays. Received the last college letter which explained about the army training school. Sure must seem strange to see everybody in uniform. You certainly must have had quite a job finding rooms for them all. How are the Delts making out? Have we any freshmen pledged yet. Don't the fraternities have a rather hard time to make both ends meet. Give my best regards to all the brothers. Also to Mike and Eda and the rest. No more news so I'll have to close.

How in the world do you expect me to know that you are a sergeant unless you tell me? In one of your letters you gave notice of the promotion of everyone else except yourself, and although I imagined that your great ability would not go long unrewarded.

Practically every one else in your gang has come back to the U.S. except you and we are rooting very much for your return shortly. It sure will be good to see you again.

<p class="left">Dear Sil:</p>

What the devil is the matter with you anyhow? You started off writing like a house a—fire and kerplunk you stopped. Is it because you [haven't] received any mail from me? You threatened to stop writing if you [didn't] hear [from me] but, if that is the reason it [isn't] my fault. I have answered every letter that I have received from you, so what more can a man do? Anyway I'm giving you this last chance. Don't think I'll write again until I hear from you. Steve White just came back from the States the other day and said that he had been down to the college and that he had seen you. He also said that we had trimmed Penn State and that we had a darn good team. You know I sure would like to see a good game of football again. Guess that I'd pretty nearly go crazy to see the old team play again. If this reaches you while Sandy is around give him my best regards. How is MIKE getting along? You all haven't been hit with the "FLU" have you? [I sure] hope that you [haven't] for I know that it is pretty bad. There has been a deuce of a lot of cases of it over here and quite a lot of it in Rahway. Do you know Elmer Hansen? He used to hang around with <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Gehring, Herbert Henry | Born: 1889. Died: 1939.
Corporal, Infantry.">Herb Gehring</button> and the Bachelor bunch. Just found out the other day that he is in the hospital with a machine gun bullet in his leg. He is he first Rahway boy that has been at the hospital and it was rather nice to see him even if I [didn't] know him very well. Gosh I pretty nearly forgot to tell you that I had seen old Delamater. Harry Janeway called up and said that he was in port so I took a trip down to see him. First time I had seen him for pretty nearly a year and a half but, he was the same old Del. [Don't] think that he has changed a bit. He was on a freight ship and thought that his next trip would be to Belfast, Ireland and that he would return to St. Nazaire so I may see him again in a couple of weeks. I sure hope so for it certainly was fine to see him again. The peeper had another sick spell lately. Think that it was the diptheria that he had this time. He is over now and on a seven day leave in Paris. His dad is at Paris doing Red Cross work so that is how he obtained his pass. It sure is pretty nice for him [isn't] it? Wish that I was in his [boots] for the time being. He also was promoted awhile ago. Is a sergeant now. Guess that that is all the news that I know about the fellows. The rest of the Rutgers Bunch are all in good health and crabbing about the same as usual. Let me have Shrimp White's address, will you Sil? Had a letter from him awhile ago and then lost it. Lost his address along with the letter and as I would like to answer it I wish that you would sent it to me. What has ever become of Pete Ainsworth and Bub and Eddie and the rest of the gang. I know that they are over here but that is all that I do know about them. Heard from Ronald Acken a while ago. He was in a hospital with a slight dose of mustard gas. he was just about to be discharged then so I guess that he is all right. Must close now and try to write a couple of other letters. Give my best regards to Eda and the rest of the family.

Just received your letter dated November 2nd. the other day and as usual was very glad to hear from you. Had written to you on the twenty—ninth, giving you a bawling out for having stopped writing, but I guess that I'll have to take it all back. [Wasn't] that hard luck about Jill Jackson? He had all the chances in the world of connecting with a contagious disease during the months that he was over here<del></del> and then to go home and catch the 'flu'. It certainly was too bad. It was news about <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Elmer, Rudolph (Dutch) | Born: 1896. Died: 1918.
Second Lieutenant, Infantry.">Dutch Elmer</button> and <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Barr, Chapin Crawford (Dick) | Born: 1895. Died: 1918.

Before I forget it, Sil, I want to tell you that I received the college letter of November 6th in the same mail as your letter. The college letter was might interesting and contained a whole lot of news. What are they going to do about the college now that the war is over? Is it still to be a war college or will it go back to the old regime? Guess that I [can't] ask you any more questions, Sil, and as I [haven't] any news I think that this note had better come to a close.

Received your short note the other day and was [certainly] glad to hear from you. I suspect that this will be somewhat similar to <del></del> yours for unless a happy line of bull strikes me, I [haven't] anything particular to say. I might make a few appropriate and forceful remarks about the weather, but if I start in [cussing] about it the whole letter will be <del></del> nothing but a line of swearing. Let it suffice that it has done nothing but rain for the last two weeks or more and that everything is [a sea] of mud. How are Eda and Mike? You [didn't] mention them so I take it that they are both in good health. You'll have a Christmas tree for Mike, [won't] you? I'll bet that he will be tickled to death with it and the presents which he will receive. Christmas sure will be here before one realizes it. I've been trying for the last month or so to buy something to send home and [haven't] succeeded so I think that I [won't] send anything. Thanks for the wish that I will be among the first home. The way it looks now, we'll be here for quite some time. There is really no telling [though] at present. We may sail in a month <del></del> and then we may not sail for six months. It surely would be pleasant to be in the States again. I'm glad that you sent me Shrimp Whites address, for I had lost it and I owed him a letter. He is mighty sore that he [wasn't] able to come across, [isn't] he? Guess that he is just as well off [though]. He might have been killed or have lost an arm or leg and then he sure would have been out of luck. It [isn't] so here where I am now, Sil. One of [the greatest] benefits is that I [don't] have to stand any formations. Get up when I please in the mornings and turn in when I please in the evenings. Generally arise at eight or eight—thirty or nine, and you know <del></del> how well that suits me. One little piece of news that I know is that Joe has been sent home as unfit for further duty. Had an attack of diptheria a while ago and it affected his heart. As a result he received a [Surgeon's Certificate of Disability] You will probably see him before this letter reaches you and learn all about it. He will probably give you a great line about how he fought the glorious battle of Savenay and how he is just recovering from a bad case of shell—shock. Had more bull than I thought that I would have so I think that I had better knock off now. Hope that you all have a most Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

<p class="left">Dear Sil:</p>

How the deuce are you all and why don't you write once in a while? Of course I have received the college letter, but, I sure would like to hear from you personally. How is Eda and the baby? I sure would like to see the little fellow. I'll bet you are having a fine time with him keeping you awake at nights. Do you have to get up and walk the floor with him? Say, what the deuce has become of Mil? It certainly is some long time since I have heard a word about her. Sil, that weekly letter from the college sure is a good thing. We all sure are glad to keep in touch with the old place and I hope you  keep on getting it out. Received the <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="This was the first incarnation of what is now the Rutgers Magazine. | From: Rutgers University Libraries"> <a href="https://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/alumni/rutgers_magazine">Alumni Quarterly</a> </button> which you sent and that was highly appreciated. But, of all the nerves for Pete's sakes what the deuce did you ever publish that letter I wrote? I sure never would have written if I had ever thought you would publish it. I sure will wallop you for doing it when I get back. I don't believe that there is any chance of sending any souvenirs of the war back as you asked for in one of the letters. In the first place I'm not in a postion to get any at present, and again, I don't know whether it would be permitted or not. I have acquired a few things and hope to get more later. What is doing at home Sil? Where is Dud? What is Father Pete doing, and Bub? I could ask  a thousand questions, but I guess it would be too boring for you to answer them. All the Rutgers bunch are well and working hard. A lot of them have been in the hospital mostly with severe colds. Joe and Doc Johnson have been in twice with very bad colds. I have been pretty lucky and have managed to keep out. Joe is still on night duty in the wards. [Believe] me every available man is working like the deuce, for we have an awful amount of work to do. You know Sil, I think that it would have taken an awful inducement to get me to enlist if I had known how much work I would have had to have done. But, now that I'm in I don't mind it so much for I'm used to it now. Believe me, I sure do sleep soundly  after working all day and it sure is mighty hard to get up at quarter to six in the morning. We get very good food [though], and that helps a lot. We haven't had hardly any snow, but, the weather sure has been cold. The French people say it is the coldest winter they have had for years and I sure do believe them. Wish I had more news, but, as I haven't I'll have to close. Don't forget to write. Give my best regards to people I know.

<p class="left">Dear Sil:</p>

Received your letter of December 20 last night and it was the first in a devil of a while. [Don't] know what has happened to your mail but it sure has gone astray some where. I may receive the letter that I have missed in a month or so. The mail system over here is pretty much balled up and we appreciate any that we do receive. I'll forgive you seeing as you have written and that [isn't] your fault that I [didn't] get them. You sure told me a lot of news. I [didn't] know what had become of hardly any of the old gang. Yes the <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Francis H. Scarr (RC 1917) was severely wounded in France. His brother, James B. Scarr, was killed in action at Chateau Thierry on June 6, 1918.">Scarr family</button> certainly [was in] hard luck and I sure did feel sorry for them. You want to know why none of the fellows [don't] you? [I've] told them<del></del> that you wished to hear from the but can hardly blame them for not writing. Hells bells [don't] you know by this time that there is nothing of interest to write about here. I thought that I had impressed that upon your mind. If we had been up where there was something going on it would have been different. But down here where we have to get drunk for a little excitement it is a different matter. I think that is the reason why none of the fellows have written. Did I tell you that I had received the receipt for the payment of the Quarterly? I [don't] know whom to thank for it but it was very kind of the ones who are responsible for it. Have a little bit of news for you <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Herbert, Wilbur Copley (Cope) | Born: 1895. Died: 1963.

Expect to be home for good in a short time so [don't] be surprised if I should blow in on you some time in the near future.

Hard luck that the son had the "Flu" and sure am glad to hear that he has suffered no damage from it. It is half past one now and I'm getting sleepy as the devil so I think that I'll have to close this letter. Hope that I see you soon.
