## August L. Grimme to William E. Grimme, September 1917


<p class="small centered"> [Page: 2] </p>

From First Lieutenant <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Grimme, August Louis | Born: 1895. Died: 1959.
First Lieutenant, Air Service."> August L. Grimme '19</button>

<p class="left">Dear <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Grimme, William Elbing | Born: 1885. Died: 19--.
Brother to August (Gustav) Grimme.">Will</button>—</p>

 I have good eats, good quarters, and a good time <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="1st Lt. Grimme would be assigned to the United States Army Air Service, the precursor to the present—day Air Force, established in 1918. | From: U.S. Air Service, vol. 5, no. 5"> <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/U_S_Air_Services/Usc7AAAAMAAJ">flying</a> </button>. Went up this morning for a two—hour joy ride; went burning all over the country. It's wonderful, the distance one can cover in a flying machine. Was up about 7000 feet this morning. It was so clear that I could see the opposite side of the lake and got a glimpse of United States soil. It sure did look good, even so far away. 

 Have been posted to the Ninety—first Squadron this evening. Haven't any more time for joy rides. I was doing artillery observation this evening; it was my fifty—seventh time up; have done about twenty—nine hours of "solo—flying" — did three and a half to—day. 

 I have had three crashes, but they don't bother me in the least. Came down in a spiral nose dive a couple of weeks ago at a rate of about 150 miles an hour, but managed to nose the machine up again before it hit the ground — came within about fifteen yards of the earth. <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Grimme was training at a pilot training camp in Leaside, North Toronto, Canada. Hungry Lizzie, the ambulance of the Royal Flying Corps, would have been stationed at the edge of the airfield during flying hours.">"*Hungary* [sic] Lizzie"</button> (the ambulance) came chasing across the field, but got fooled. We have a peach of an ambulance; it is a big white Packard with a regular hospital inside. 

 I will probably leave camp shortly, having *complete* [sic] my course here, and will go back to the University of Toronto for the school of aeronautics. Will be there three weeks, and then go to <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Camp Borden, Ontario, Canada"><a href='https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=44_16_18_N_079_54_45_W'>Camp Borden</a></button> for aerial gunnery and photography. This latter course is a three weeks' course; and then I'm through and ready for my commission. We have tests and examinations as we go along. Passed my instructor's flying test the other day. 

I tell you what you could send me—the Newark Evening News. I seldom see a states paper, and then it is from New York, Chicago, Detroit, Washington, San Francisco or some other town, but never Newark.

<p class="left">Dear Mr. Silvers,</p>

 Allow me to add my appreciation of the work you and your Bureau are doing. It was a fine idea and has proved a success, for once a Rutgers man, always a Rutgers man. Have read the January number of the Alumni Quarterly from cover to cover and am anxiously looking forward to the next number. No doubt my copy of this cherished magazine is not the only one to receive this treatment. 

 An American cadet tells me of

I am now located at a flying school in the Midlands of England where I have undergone a course of instruction on the type of machine which I *ex—pect* [sic] to fly in France. Am going to another camp to receive a bit more training before going to the front. 

 Although I am shifting around so much, mail will reach me if addressed c/o <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="18 Austin Friars, London, UK"><a href='https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=51_30_57_N_0_5_10_W'>Seligman Bros.,  18 August Friars, London, E.C.</a></button> who are very kindly forwarding my mail wherever I may be sent. 

 Here's hoping the next Alumni Quarterly will soon be here and that the next weekly letter will contain continued good news of the Alma Mater.

 The following telegram has been sent by our Commander in Chief, General Pershing: "All commanding officers ask that every officer and soldier of the <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="The AEF comprised the United States' troops who fought on the Western Front. | From: Library of Congress"> <a href="https://www.loc.gov/collections/stars-and-stripes/articles-and-essays/a-world-at-war/american-expeditionary-forces/">American Expeditionary Forces</a> </button> would write a letter home on Mother's day. This is a little thing for one to do, but these letters will carry back our courage and our affection to the patriotic women whose love and prayers inspire us and cheer us to victory." 

 Pershing.

 Today is Mother's day and a good opportunity to write you and say how much I think of home and you. But every day is 
<p class="small centered"> [Page: 14] </p>

 Mother's day for me. I will soon be in France. The thought of you will give me added courage and the knowledge that I cannot come home until the message of victory comes with me.

 My Father asked me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of May 17th, and to state that he would be very glad to receive a copy of your Quarterly. 

 He has asked me also to send you extracts from my brother's letters written from Abroad. In his last communication, he states, that upon its receipt he would be in France. Undoubtedly at this writing he is at the Front, and I am certain, one of the many Rutgers' boys who are upholding the best traditions of their Alma Mater.
