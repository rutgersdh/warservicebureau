Although it is rather a late date I want to thank you very much for the various college publications which you have sent. The letters and quarterlies have been a fine thing in keeping us in touch with the college news. As you already know there are a large number of Rutgers fellows in this unit and a larger delegation from Princeton.

The term 'train' is unique to the first World War. There were four assigned to each infantry division: ammunition, supply, engineer, and sanitary. All were mobile and used either horse—drawn or motorized wagons to support the division. Sanitary trains were composed of camp infirmaries, ambulance companies, and field hospitals. An ambulance company's main objective was to transport wounded soldiers from a batallion aid station back to a field hospital. In cases where medical emergencies were dire, ambulance companies set up dressing stations en route to field hospitals in order to provide continuous care to soldiers. | From: Ireland, M. W.

Any news which I may be able to tell you about the hospital will no doubt be old to you. We have been having a few fall games recently — three in all of which we have won two. <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Storck, Donald G. | Born: 1897. Died: 1987.

We were all mighty proud

It was good of you to write your letter of [March] 28th and to tell me that you fellows over there appreciate the War Service Bureau and its work. Remember me to all of the Rutgers men at the Base Hospital and tell them to write to me whenever they can find the time.
