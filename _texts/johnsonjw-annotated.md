### Biographical Note

John William Johnson (RC 1917) was born in 1895 in Stanton, NJ, to parents Jennie Opdyke Creveling and Dr. Frederick Lincoln Johnson. One of six children, he was the only son. Following perhaps in his father's physician footsteps, he enlisted as a private with the New York Post-Graduate Hospital, in New York City, which organized Base Hospital #8 in Savenay, France. Once in Savenay, he was joined by several other Rutgers men, including Elmer "Toady" Bracher, Frank Broome, Joe Herben, Morris "Jill" Jackson, Carl "Slates" Maar, Frank Merritt, Ross Miner, Meff Runyon, Ralph Spencer Voorhees Jr., and Anton Ward. Owing perhaps to his relatively congenial circumstances, surrounded by familiar faces and several hundred miles from the Front, and to the terrible crush of patients at BH #8 in the spring and summer of 1918, Johnson writes only once. Joe Costa's letter to Silvers suggests that Johnson may have suffered from a communicable disease of some sort (scarlet fever? mumps?) while working there, but he was apparently only briefly sidelined by it.

Johnson was mustered out of service at the rank of sergeant in March of 1919. He married Hilda Titus of East Orange, NJ, in 1921. His work drew him to chemical manufacturing and he soon after co-founded Pettit Paint Company, a manufacturer of marine coatings, where he worked for the remainder of his career.

Although it is rather a late date I want to thank you very much for the various college publications which you have sent. The letters and quarterlies have been a fine thing in keeping us in touch with the college news. As you already know there are a large number of Rutgers fellows in this unit and a larger delegation from Princeton.

The term 'train' is unique to the first World War. There were four assigned to each infantry division: ammunition, supply, engineer, and sanitary. All were mobile and used either horse—drawn or motorized wagons to support the division. Sanitary trains were composed of camp infirmaries, ambulance companies, and field hospitals. An ambulance company's main objective was to transport wounded soldiers from a batallion aid station back to a field hospital. In cases where medical emergencies were dire, ambulance companies set up dressing stations en route to field hospitals in order to provide continuous care to soldiers. | From: Ireland, M. W.
