Your letter of September 18 was very welcome. Here at the college we have been worrying about you and our only word has come indirectly. We are glad to know that your injured limb is in the process of healing and we trust that you will not have to spend very much more time in the hospital.

There must be a lot of satisfaction to you in the thought that you have served so bravely and courageously in the big cause in which you are enlisted.
