### Biographical note

We learn next to nothing about Graham Pelton, RC '18, based on the few letters in his file. We know that he worked first in the personnel office of the First Replacement Regiment of Engineers, and next in the Engineer School, both at Washington Barracks, D.C. In a way, Pelton's position was enviable. He had a coveted desk job and never saw action during the war. Pelton remained a private in the Engineer Corps for the duration of his service. According to his military service record, he had two years previous training in the Officers' Reserve Corps, and was recommended four times for sergeancy, "but orders were never issued." Given the somewhat haphazard and rushed way in which the Army built its officer corps, equating leadership first with a college education, and next with subjective qualities like charisma, it is possible that Pelton lost a popularity contest of sorts. Furthermore, the purpose of the First Replacement Regiment of Engineers was to churn out trained combat engineers for active duty in France. They weren't meant to linger, hence Pelton would have had few opportunities to establish rapport in his role, further isolating him. Pelton asks Silvers twice for a list of enlisted Rutgers men in the vicinity of Washington, first in June and next in August 1918, presumably because he was hoping to see a friendly face. Silvers replies on August 27, 1918 to say "[w]e are short of clerical help just now and it is not possible for us to give the time to such work." Pelton's only subsequent communication is to notify Silvers of an address change, stating that he "[s]hould like very much to receive your War Letters as heretofore." His communication style is fairly typical of soldiers' correspondence of the era, which is to say laconic out of a desire to project good morale. One infers his state of mind only through his frequent correspondence with Silvers, whom he evidently did not know well, and who responded only once to Pelton's four letters. After being discharged in February 1919, Pelton returned to life as a civil engineer in Essex, Connecticut.
