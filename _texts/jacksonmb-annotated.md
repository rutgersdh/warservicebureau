![Two obituaries for Morris Jackson](../../assets/figs/jacksonmb.png "Obituaries from the Delta Upsilon Quarterly and the Brooklyn Daily Eagle")

### Biographical note

Morris "Jill" Jackson put his Rutgers coursework in agriculture to work directing a convalescents' farm at U.S. Base Hospital No. 8 in Savenay France. There, he was joined by seven other Rutgers men working in the Medical Department. In fall 1918, Jackson was sent back to the U.S. to escort a group of officers suffering from shell shock (post-traumatic stress disorder) to the neuro-psychiatry ward of General Hospital No. 30 in Plattsburgh, New York. One senses that this was not a choice assignment; Jackson himself notes in a letter that Don Storck and Mefford Runyon were considered "too valuable" for the trip. In compensation for his effort, Jackson was awarded a 15-day leave to visit his family. He was ill with influenza by the time he reached his parents' home in Brooklyn. His condition worsened until he died on October 27, 1918, aged twenty years old.

The influenza pandemic of 1918 inflicted five to ten times more casualties than the war (somewhere between 50 and 100 million people died), and yet for a time, as scholars like Elizabeth Outka point out, it was seemingly forgotten. Outka [writes](https://modernismmodernity.org/forums/posts/outka-grievability-covid): 

> The war was what seemed real, and war deaths were what seemed important. Flu deaths were difficult to spin into stories of victory or needful sacrifices. The disease suggested bodily vulnerability and weakness, not a masculine power struggle or a larger political goal. 

In the letters that follow, and in the above clippings of his obituaries, we see this forgetting happening in real time as Jackson's flu death is reclaimed as a war death. Both the obituary printed in the _Brooklyn Daily Eagle_ and his father's letter to Earl Reed Silvers devote several paragraphs to Jackson's war service and only a cursory mention of  his death from influenza. There were simply no words for this tragedy that was unfolding in the war's shadow.  

If Jackson's death could be made comprehensible and grievable as a war death, no such treatment is reserved for the victims of shell shock. It is hard to miss the contempt that Knights of Columbus representative J. K. Paulding has for the officers Jackson accompanies back to the United States. His letter to Mrs. Jackson eulogizes Jackson in part by contrasting his "beautiful spirit" with the "degraded beings" in his care. In scholar Elaine Showalter's view, a much discussed "crisis of masculinity" during the First World War reached its paroxysm with shell shock, a masculine mirror of what psychiatrists had previously understood to be the uniquely feminine condition of hysteria.

On One side of the farm is a dam which has made the A. E.

On still another side is the main highway where train after train of trucks pass by with men, supplies and accessories for other somewheres that the railroad dont reach. *Andstill* [sic] on the other side of the hill is an American Quarry where American engineers are making big ones into little ones while the U.S. mules he—haw at the dump wagons. So you see we are rather well Americanized.

The boys of course, expected to get a bit of time at home but when the major saw the list he said Storck and Runyon are too valuable around here so they don't get to go.

We expect to entertain the patients who have worked here on the farm on the Fourth of July.

<button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Typewritten transcript of a letter that W. W. Jackson sent to Silvers to be copied.">I have just heard of Morris' death</button>, and cannot forbear writing you a line, even at the risk of intruding upon your great grief. I don't know when I have met a finer boy, and I had learned how to love him almost as a son. I shall never visit the farm again, where he was stationed latterly, without a feeling of mute pain. I used to go there occasionally to take supper with the boys, and the chief pleasure to me was sitting afterwards in the doorway or on the flagging and talking with him. It seems to me now as if I could never bear taking supper there again.

I had a postal card from him written on his arrival at <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Newport News, VA"><a href='https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=36_58_6_N_76_25_45_W'>Newport News</a></button> in which he said he wished he had not left here, he had seen too much of the world since leaving. I know he referred to the nursing and horror of the demented, and I am afraid often degraded beings whom he had to care for on his way over. I can imagine the shock it must have been to his sensitive nature.

I remember the beautiful spirit in which he took an unjust criticism levelled at the conduct of the Farm in which he took so useful a part. The other man there was justly angry and *di* [sic] not conceal it. Morris never ceased smiling and was moderate in all his comment, it seemed sufficient to him that he had done his full duty and it did not too much concern him if there happened to be somebody who could not recognize it.

I often had occasion to recognize in him a higher spirit and one more genuinely interested in serious things than in most of the other men about. Perhaps that was the result of a different and better home *taining* [sic], but it was surprising in a boy so fitted for every sort of outdoor delight to find him discriminating in what he read and instinctively averse to the trash that the average fellow fares for.

I have seldom seen a handsomer fellow— what a joy to find a beautiful spirit, a lovely nature, behind the outward beauty: Perhaps, my dear Mrs. Jackson, you can come to feel in time, if not just at present, that he is now irrevocably and for all time, what you would wish him to be, past danger of change or taint, secure in purity and serenity of his youthful manhood. His memory will always remain an inspiration to me. The world is the sweeter for his *so journed* [sic] among us.

If you have a photograph of his, that you can spare, I should deeply appeciate having it.

After what I have written, I do not need to tell you how largely I share in the grief of his father and yourself, you have my deepest sympathy.

<p class="left">My dear Mr. Jackson;—</p>

Thank you very much for your letter of *Novemver* [sic] 26th, containing picture of your son Morris. The facts given, together with the photograph, are just what we wish for publication in the January issue of the Rutgers Alumni Quarterly. If you will advise me of the number of copies you may be able to use, I shall be pleased to send them to you.

Morris' death was a big shock to us here at the college. He always seemed to me so vitally alive, so full of a youthful zest in the pure joy of living, that it is hard to realize that he has crossed the border. Words in a time like this are always futile, but I hope that you will accept my sincere sympathy. It must give you a good deal of satisfaction to know that you son's life was clean and wholesome and that his death came while he was in the service of the nation

<p class="centered small">(3)</p> You speak of his always being happy in his work the "joy of living" — so I venture to enclose a copy of letter from a <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Knights of Columbus">K of C</button> representative that

<p class="centered small">(4)</p> speaks of this same trait. Do not bother to answer this — nor to return Enclosure. I know you have many letters to write — and many that call for sympathy.
