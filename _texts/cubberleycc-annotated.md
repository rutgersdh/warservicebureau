<p class="left">Dear Sir:—</p>

 I have been trying to find the time to drop you a few lines and have finally succeeded. I am no longer at <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Pelham Bay, NY"><a href='https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?params=40_51_58_N_73_48_37_W'>Pelham Bay</a></button> as you can see by the heading of my letter, but at Whitestone L.I. 

 I am glad to hear that <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Hartley, George Russell | Born: 1895. Died: 1947.
Lieutenant, 58th Artillery, Coast Artillery Corps.">Rus Hartley</button> is at <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Fort Totten, NY"><a href='https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?params=40_47_31.3_N_73_46_33.9_w'>Fort Totten</a></button> and will try to get in touch with him. The Fort is just a short way from our Base and is on the same side of the river. 

 I am acting as bugler at the Base now and that gives me more time for studying than I had 
<p class="small centered"> [Page: 2] </p>

 at either <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Bensonhurst, NY"><a href='https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?params=40_36_10_N_74_0_6_W'>Bensonhurst</a></button> or Pelham Bay.

 I have had some pictures taken and only just received the proofs, but I will forward one to you as soon as I get the finished product. 

 I might also state that we had quite a blizzard here last week and that a north west storm is raging to—day. 

<p class="indent-1"> Hoping to hear from you soon I am. <br> Very sincerely yours </p>

We shall be grateful for your kindness if you will send us a brief sketch of his life, his place and date of birth, schooling, etc., and his career in the Navy. A letter or two which he wrote while in servicewwould be of much value to the college. We would like his picture also, in uniform if possible. Everything which you may care to send us will be returned unharmed within a week of its receipt. 

 May I extend the sympathy of Chester’s friends here in college to you. His death came as a great shock to us, and we grieve with you.

Thank you very much for your letter of September 30th. I can wait until October 12th for the picture of Chester but in order to appear in our magazine it will have to be here by that date. Chester's picture and biography will appear in the October issue of the Rutgers Alumni Quarterly. If you will let us know how many copies you wish to have we shall be very pleased to send them to you free of charge. We can at least do that much for the mother of one of our Rutgers boys who has made the big sacrifice. I am inclosing a list of questions about Chester. If you will fill them out and return them to me at once I shall be able to include a story of his life with the photograph. I thank you for your interest.

<p class="left">Dear Mr Silvers:</p>

Cadet, Naval Reserve Force.">Chester Cubberley</button> but found that as you said there was little or nothing I could add to what Mrs <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Bowers, Mary Ann | Born: 1853. Died: 1934.
Mother to Chester Cubberley.">Cubberley</button> had sent you. In talking 
<p class="small centered"> [Page: 19] </p>

 with his mother however I noticed that nothing appeared in the questions about his _devotion [?]_ to the church. Chester was very loyal to the Presbyterian Church of Long Branch of which he was a member and in which he was an active member 
<p class="small centered"> [Page: 20] </p>

 taking the lead in the Young Peoples work. He was a young fellow who had high ambitions and much determination to make the best of himself. I should have thought that he would have been the one least likely to perish but he was the first from the town to be taken. He is greatly mourned by his family.

 I received the twelve copies of Alumni Quarterly and think it a verry fine magazine and I thank you for them. I havent received the picture of <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Cubberley, Chester C. | Born: 1897. Died: 1918.

I thought I would wait until all the things came and thank you for all together but time was so near christmas that I felt I would like to have his picture then if possiable. I know it must be an over sight for you are so good to me that I know you would not keep me waiting for it if you could help it.

<p class="left"> My dear Mrs. Cubberley:—</p>

I am very sorry that I have neglected to return <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Cubberley, Chester C. | Born: 1897. Died: 1918.
Cadet, Navel Reserve Force.">Chester</button>'s picture and letter to you. I did not know that there was any immediate desire for it and I have not given it the attention which it should have had. I am sending you now under separate cover both the picture and letter but I am afraid that the rush of Christmas season will not permit your receiving it by Wednesday. However, I sincerely hope that you do get it in time.

I am also sending you the <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Probably a getatin dry plate, regarded as a practical improvement upon the collodion negative process.

I thank you very much for your good Christmas wishes.
