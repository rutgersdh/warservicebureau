 I am very sorry that I could not attend the meeting of the Alumni Council on April 13th. These happen to be very busy days with me, as I plan to start shortly for overseas service in connection with the Y.M.C.A., my Church having granted me eight months leave of absence.

This is just to thank you for the War Service letters. I came over last May to work under the Y.M.C.A.; but the <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="gloss | A derogatory term for a German.

They demolished the hut and incidentally sent a chunk of high explosive through my right leg. The result has been that I have spent the summer of 1918 on the flat of my back with the aforesaid leg hung up in a complicated apparatus which has kept my right toe pointing at the North star for three months.

Some day soon or late <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon=" 'arrived in New York Christmas eve'  | From: Association Men. v. 44.

I am afraid, however, I have lost my drive.

It begins to look as if America had sent a real army overseas. Well, it has been on of the big privileges of my life to have some association with it, short as it was. It has been worth coming over, despite my contact with a ten inch shell.

Keep on with the letters. I shall be in the hospital some time yet.

Your letter of September 18 was very welcome. Here at the college we have been worrying about you and our only word has come indirectly. We are glad to know that your injured limb is in the process of healing and we trust that you will not have to spend very much more time in the hospital.

There must be a lot of satisfaction to you in the thought that you have served so bravely and courageously in the big cause in which you are enlisted.
