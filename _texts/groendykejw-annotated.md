### Biographical note

Jacob W. Groendyke was born in Monmouth Junction, NJ, in 1891 to parents Jacob J. Groendyke and Christiana Hutchinson. He attended New Brunswick High School in addition to Rutgers, where he graduated as a member of the class of 1912.
                    
Prior to the war, Groendyke served as a clerk in the accounting department of the American Telephone and Telegraph Co. in New York City. He entered the war as a non-commissioned officer with Company "E" in the 312th Infantry, part of the 78th Division. His position was in the intelligence section. His letters briefly describe the nightly "airplane exhibition[s]" used to gather intelligence about German positions. Groendyke was a first lieutenant by the time he left France from the port of Brest on December 24, 1918. After demobilization, he returned to American Telephone and Telegraph, where he continued until his retirement in 1956 as a vice president of accounting.

Groendyke's letters of July 1918 have an elegiac quality to them. As nearly as we can tell, his division would have been in the vicinity of Oudezeele, France, close to the Flemish border, together with the First British Army. This would have been a staging area for an eventual troop movement south to Arras. Thomas Meehan's history confirms Groendyke's account of constant air fights, high-explosive shells, and moonlight bombings. This part of the country would have been evacuated by residents, hence the abandoned livestock and unharvested crops Groendyke observes. Perhaps it is the book-keeper in him that can't help but remark on the war's extravagant waste of animals, food, and materials, not to mention human lives.

 I was out of luck to some degree Sat. I arrived at the gate at 2:30 and inquired at the window and of _General [?]_ about the tickets and you. They were both chock full of ignorance. However I succeeded in buying two seats where the view was not half bad. 

 You did all you could I'm sure and I do appreciate it a lot. 

 The game was a dazzler. The letters are coming regularly, and are a good binder between the boys and the college I'm sure.

<p class="right">July 5, 1918.</p>

 As I sit here in the scanty straw of this evacuated barn, it calls to mind the song "Fiddle and I" waking up the cats and owls, well there are no owls here, the nights are not quiet enough for their kind of work. But as the saying is over here, "*its* [sic] not too bad." In all the area here abouts the villages and farm houses are shelled to brick dust as at this point a very determined enemy drive was followed up by a vigorous counter attack, so what ever <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="British army slang for a German. | From: Walker, Julian. Slang terms at the Front. The British Library (2014)."> <a href="https://www.bl.uk/world-war-one/articles/slang-terms-at-the-front">Jerry</a> </button> left standing the Allied shells reduced to dust. Around the ruins of the old houses we sometimes greet the old house dog who has wandered back to his old home, and a few pigs or chickens which could not be carried away are left at some places. Farm implements and household goods lie in disorder around the premises just as the _staunch [?]_ people left as they fled from before the invader. Splendid crops of shoulder high, wheat oats and hops are standing in the fields. I wonder who will gather them. 

 Flowers grow by the roadside in spite of the tread of the <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Doughboy was popular nickname for American soldiers during World War I. | From: The National

A woman's voice or a child's laughter are sounds that are never heard in the advance zones. 

 As far as the eye can reach there is nought but ruins. But there is no lack for entertainment here for while I write this sentence probably 10 or 15 big shells go whizzing over some goin' and some comin'. They say that every time an American artilleryman fires a round he repeats "Now Kaiser count your men." 

 Yesterday the 4th was duly celebrated here. All was decently quiet till nine o'clock in the morning when Jerry let go a perfect hail storm of shells of all calibers. In every barrage of this order it is interesting to see how a certain sector is isolated and boxed off, every road of approach is laid off to a nicety with <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="High explosive">H.E.</button> shells. Well everybody back as far as <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="It is hard to tell what was intended here.

A few days ago in a fight though we saw a Jerry come down in flames. I'm surely getting a lot of my old intelligence work up here and it's not seemed handed either. *Its* [sic] nice and cool here and I'm feeling fine.

<p class="right">July 8 1918</p>

<p class="left">Dear Reed.—</p>

 So far as I can recall our extensive correspondence has not been reopened since I notified you that a change was about to take place in my address. Well since then we have become somewhat widely separated. We had the usual "inconveniences" of a troop ship coming over, however we have been quite thoroughly inoculated against fretfulness and fatigue so we enjoyed the trip a lot. 

 Right after getting clear of harbor gun crews were appointed to work with the gunmen of the boat. Since I looked more like a gunman than a gunner they chose me for Sergeant of the crew and gun trainer. 
<p class="centered large">For God, For King & For Country.<br> Y·M·C·A<br> H.M.FORCES ON ACTIVE SERVICE</p>
 We had only one affair with Subs. This occurred on a calm Sunday night just after mess time. Several boats attacked our fleet but none of us was hit. One or two of the enemy were sunk by depth charges. When one is below decks and hears the reverberations of these charges against the side plates of the ship and he has not experienced the sensation before: it immediately makes him think of a cold salt bath. 

 We are in a very pretty section of <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Since Groendyke's infantry regiment was attached to the 78th division, he was likely somewhere in the vicinity of Oudezeele, France, at this time. | From: Meehan, T.F.

<p class="centered large">For God, For King & For Country.<br> Y·M·C·A<br> H.M.FORCES ON ACTIVE SERVICE</p> in his letters, so I'll not burden you with descriptions of wild rose and honeysuckle hedges, and wheat fields mottled with great large scarlet poppies. 

 Here every building is battered flat, its occupants have fled, leaving a great part of their household goods and farm implements. *Its* [sic] quite pathetic to see the old house dog and the store cat come back and beg food from the soldier as he sits in front of the great, wide, open fire place in which the ancient iron kettle swings. How many peaceful Christmas logs must have burned in that great chimney place as a merry crowd assembled around in the stone floored kitchen!

 I'm extremely well, army rations and billets of various descriptions (This abode is a <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Hop kilns, also known as oasts, were traditional facilities for drying hops. | From: Wikipedia"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oast_house">hop kiln</a> </button>) seem to be no wise injurious so far.
