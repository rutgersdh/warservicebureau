It is a Catholic Chaplain attached to the <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="The prestige of the French cuirassiers, a unit of cavalry known for their elaborate uniforms, dated from the Napoleonic Wars.

Kindly pardon me; but I thought you might be happy to know that he who writes you this was with your son when the shell exploded.

 I liked <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Conklin, Sherman L. | Born: 1894. Died: 1918.

 We happened upon one another before <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="This letter was translated from the original French, which was not kept by Silvers.

We were chatting peacefully in spite of the shells that were exploding around us. Alas! It was to be our last conversation. A shell fell in our midst and several men were struck, among them your dear son. After the first shock, I went to him, made the sign of the cross upon his forehead as a last benediction and repeated a prayer in the name of his mother. Your son, Madam, was as though he slept. 

Some of the men unfortunately were wounded: two of our surgeons. After having carried these off with the assistance of Bridget, a friend of Herman's, I returned I did my utmost to bring the body of our poor comrade to his American friends who buried him at <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Mortefontaine, France"><a href='https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?params=49_19_53_N_3_4_31_E'>Mortefontain</a></button>.

<p class="left">My dear Mrs. Conklin,—</p>

I cannot express my regard for the bravery of you have sacrificed so much more than a mere physical life. I know <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Conklin, Sherman L. | Born: 1894. Died: 1918.
Private, Ambulence Service.">Sherman</button> appreciates it with all the vividness of his present understanding.

Nothing could have been nearer to Sherman’s desire concerning, if necessary, than were the actual circumstances. He was waiting for his load of wounded at our farthest post in front of the village of <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Montgobert, France"><a href='https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?params=49_18_22_N_3_8_56_E'>Montgobert</a></button>, a little north of the <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Villers—Cotterêts, France"><a href='https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?params=49_15_36_N_3_05_26_E'>Villers Cotterets</a></button>. At the time he was speaking to a French priest who is attached to one of the regiments. The shell struck in the midst of the little group killing Sherman instantly and wounding several others. He died as he had wished with a smile on his lips, and for the lives of the men who fall. The body was laid at rest the next day in the little village cemetery of <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Taillefontaine, France"><a href='https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?params=49_18_43_N_3_02_36_E'>Taillefontaine</a></button> and the spot is marked with a cross. The French Catholic mass was read while cannon roared in the valley at one side and shrapnel burst over the other side.

Our hearts are all with you in your great sacrifice, tho' we can express our sympathy only in clumsy words.

<p class="left">Dear Mrs. Conklin,</p>

 We are anxious to have Sherman's picture in the October issue of the <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="The first incarnation of what is now the Rutgers Magazine  | From: Rutgers University Libraries"> <a href="https://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/alumni/rutgers_magazine">RUTGERS ALUMNI QUARTERLY</a> </button> together with a full account of his life and death. We shall be very grateful if you will send us a photograph of him; also whatever details you may have about his death. perhaps a letter or two from his comrades, or a letter from Sherman himself. Everything will be well taken care of and returned to you undamaged within a week of its receipt. 

 Sherman's death was a big shock to his many friends at the college. His life was so full of promise that it seemed wrong, somehow, to have it cut off so abruptly. But it must be a world of comfort to you to have hod such a son. I am sure that he died with a smile on his lips, and with the knowledge that he had not made so splendid a sacrifice in vain. We Rutgers men are very proud of him.

Thank you very much for your letter of December 22nd enclosing check for $4.00 for the Alumni Quarterlies which were sent you. I hope you do not mind, but I am returning your check. It is very good of you to send it but the Alumni Quarterly is at present self—supporting and we are only too glad to be able to serve in sending to Sherman's family copies of the magazine containing his 'In Memoriam' article. It is very little that we can do but I trust we can do that much for him.

I am rather at a loss as to how to answer definetely your question about securing copies of the <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Founded in 1869, The Targum is the second oldest college newspaper in the United States.

If you will give me allitle time I shall try to find out the best way in which we may gather together all of Sherman's writings. I shall try very hard to find some way which will not necessitate yur coming to New Brunswick and doing the work yourself and shall write you just as soon as I can conveniently arrange things.

Under seperate cover is going six copies of the Quarterly to Miss Ellen C. Hovey.

<p class="indent-1">Very sincerely yours,</p>

It was very kind to let us have all of those copies of the Quarterly, and I cannot half thank you — I feel as if I should not ask for any more copies without paying for them — There are so

 many of Sherman's friends, who would not see the Quarterly to whom I want to send copies — I am thinking of the men in his Ambulance Section in France, and of others.

Would it be possible for us to have more copies? I will be so glad to pay for them

<p class="left">Dear Mrs. Conklin;—</p>

I would gladly send you fifty copies of the October issue of the Quarterly if we had them, but calls have been so frequent and many that there are only twenty left. For college records and filing purposes, we should really have more than that number. 

I think, however, that by dropping a line to a few of Sherman’s classmates, I can gather a few extra copies together. Under separate cover I am mailing you six.

Please do not bother about their cost. I am very sorry that I cannot send you a great many more.

Just as soon as things are straightened out here at the college, I shall take up the matter of collecting <button data-balloon-pos="up" data-balloon-length="large" data-balloon="Conklin wrote poetry and prose for the Field Service Bulletin (published by the American Field Service in Paris).
