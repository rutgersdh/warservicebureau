  <h1>About the project</h1>
  <p>The War Service Bureau of Rutgers College was established in August 1917 and continued its operations through the end of the war to June 1919. Its mission was "to keep Rutgers students in contact with the college as well as with each other during World War I." <sup id="fn1:return" style="font-size: 0.8em;"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></p>

  <p>We invite you to explore selected correspondence from the War Service Bureau that has been transcribed, edited, and encoded by students of Rutgers&#8211;New Brunswick and Rutgers Future Scholars. Editorial tooltips, displayed by hovering over underlined text, provide additional contextual information about people, places, and events.</p>

  <p>This site is currently under development. At present, you will find fully edited versions of the correspondence for the alumni appearing in the table of contents. In preparation: short biographical headnotes, interactive correspondence maps, and manuscript images with facing edited letters.</p>
