The War Service Bureau edition is an ongoing pedagogical project to teach digital editing with the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) markup. A slightly outdated tutorial for contributing to the project, based loosely on an assignment by M. H. Beals, may be found at <https://github.com/giannetti/TEI-Close-Reading>. Stay tuned for updates to our project documentation.    

## Data and Software

The War Service Bureau edition uses the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator with the [Ed theme](https://minicomp.github.io/ed/) for minimal editions. A few selectors were added to the `_ed.scss` file to render structural elements typical of correspondence and surveys, such as postmarks, sender and recipient addresses, pre-printed text and handwritten responses. See the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rutgersdh/warservicebureau) for more.

The TEI-XML encodings of the letters, together with the project schema and various processing stylesheets, may be found on GitHub at <https://github.com/rutgersdh/wsb-data>.
